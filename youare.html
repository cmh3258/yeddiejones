                    I created this album to share God's love with people, not to make money. 
                    With that being said, people love to give to causes, things and others they support.
                    If you are one of these people who feel inclined to give because of this album, click

                <h3>The Story</h3>
                <p>
                    During my first couple years in college, sometime around 2011, I became interested in djing. I would watch DJs for hours on YouTube spinning and mixing and I thought it was so cool. As I kept watching I would stumble upon people making beats. Using drum pads, sampling, playing the keys and so on. It was my new love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Christmas 2014, my girlfriend at the time (my wife now!), got me my first midi controller. The Akai Mpk Mini 2. The previous couple of months I had been trying to make beats, and man were they terrible. But I was having a blast, so she fueled the flame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The beginning of 2016 I put out my first music on soundcloud. I finally felt like I was at the place where my music was listenable. Around the same time I had thought it would be so cool to make an album that was a mesh between chill hip hop and christian/worship music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A year later, in 2017, I had made so much more music and grown a ton in producing - learning to mix and master a bit, some piano chords and even dipped into sampling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The years of 2014 - 2017 I call my "Identity Years". During this time I was a part of a ministry school learning about who God was, who I was, and being in relationship with Holy Spirit. I was questioning everything, learning more and being awakened to who I was in Christ. It was such a foundating building time in my life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project is an outcome of these years. It is my heart. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe God is awakening the world to who we really are. And ultimately who God the Father is. I pray that your time listening and emerging yourself into the music will bring about much life and many questions. Questions that will drive you to seek God and to come to know how God he truly is.

                    Jesus is led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness where he is tempted by satan. The first thing that was challenged? His identity. I often find that the number one problem people have is due to them not knowing who they are. They believe a lie from their childhood and it ruins them forever, unless they challenge that lie. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beauty is one of those major components. If you can't look at yourself how are you supposed to love yourself. And if you can't love yourself, how can you love others? "Love your neighbor as yourself", you must love yourself so you can love and be love to others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are beautiful.

                    God the Father had been so misrepresented and confused by others that Jesus had to come and reveal who he actually was. God is good, and all that God did, Jesus did. Gods character is fully manifested as the man Jesus, the living word. Jesus revealed how good God truly is, and he has always been that way. He is with you and he is for you.

                    In 2015, My wife made me a painting of a heart with a tree growing out of it. The next couple of months I was told multiple times from different people, that they saw me by a tree and I was spending time with God or that there was growth happening inside my heart, and so on. It was pretty crazy. My first thought for an album cover was the heart, with a little seed about to grow. And so it became.
